My first repository...Hello World! :)

My name is James. I'm learning game development on iOS and HTML5. I am a strong front-end developer with 10+ years of experience building websites for all of the latest devices using webkits, javascript (native or frameworks), Angular, JQuery, HTML, CSS3, AJAX and PHP. I'm studying Ruby, iOS development with xcode and Cocoas-2d. I aspire to be a mobile game developer having a couple games completed by end of year. If you come across this page please ping me and say hi.  I would gladly like to meet others with similar goals in mind.
